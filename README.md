# DSA_Programs
**Data Structures and Algorithms Programs Repository**
This repository contains a collection of programs based on various concepts of data structures and algorithms. These programs cover fundamental topics such as linked lists, arrays, recursion, binary trees, and more. They were completed as part of the curriculum during the 5th semester of our B.Tech program, where we were introduced to the principles of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA).
**Purpose**
The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate my understanding and implementation of data structures and algorithms. Each program represents a specific concept or problem that I have successfully implemented using DSA. By exploring these programs, readers can gain insights into my knowledge of data structures and algorithms and observe how I have applied them to solve real-world problems efficiently.

Enjoy exploring the world of data structures and algorithms and discovering efficient solutions to computational problems!
